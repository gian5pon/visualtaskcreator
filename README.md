The project was part of a computer programming assignment for the MSc. in Cognitive and Decision Sciences at UCL
The project leverages O-O coding and libraries such as PsychoPy for an interface to generate fully functioning visual tasks according to parameters that can be set by the user.
The experiment generated via this interface are meant to test participant's attentional mechanisms and related performance.
