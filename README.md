The project was part of a computer programming assignment for the MSc. in Cognitive and Decision Sciences at UCL.
The project leverages O-O coding and libraries such as PsychoPy for an interface to generate fully functioning visual tasks according to parameters set by the user.
The experiments generated via this interface are meant to reliably test participants attentional mechanisms and related performance.
